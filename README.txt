The vimcolor module highlights code in many different formats. VIM is a common
programmers text editor for (usually) unix based systems. Out of the box VIM
can color the syntax of 200+ languages including PHP, Perl, C, HTML, Fortran,
Haskell, Java, etc. This plugin is a PURE paricy of Drupal vimcolor module,
even most of this README is. 

I like WordPress and CodeHighlight plugin. But I'm not quite satisfied by the 
number of formats CodeHighlight supports.  Sometimes I need to post some config 
files like .htaccees which CodeHighlight doesn't recognize. And I just recall 
that there is a vimcolor module for drupal that I ever used. That's all the story
behind this plugin.

This is my first PHP program. I know NOTHING about php so don't blaim me about
the style or something. :) Some functions, such as _decode_entities(), are
copied from drupal source code because Drupal vimcolor module uses them.

I still don't know how to add horizontal scroll bar automaticlly like
CodeHighlight plugin does, which I like very much. Can somebody help me on
this?

This module requires Perl version 5.6 or better (5.8 is optimal) and the
Text::VimColor module available on CPAN.  The text editor, VIM, is also
required.  From what I can tell from the CPAN testers Text::VimColor does not
run well under Windows

See INSTALL.txt for installation steps.
